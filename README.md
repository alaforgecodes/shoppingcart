This program was design to help a hypothetical storefront operate. This was part 
of a project for Udacity's Intro to Programming Nanodegree. The original project 
was designed to test Javascript skills, so all HTML and CSS was provided for students. 
Since I did not work on those parts of the code myself, I have not included them here.
