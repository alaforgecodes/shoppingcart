# shoppingcart
This program contains functions to help an online storefront operate. The program allows users to add products to their cart, increase/decrease quantity, and pay once they are ready to check out. 

# Background
This was part of a project for Udacity's Intro to Programming Nanodegree program. The original project was designed to test Javascript skills, so all HTML and CSS was provided for students. Since I did not work on those parts of the code myself, I have not included them here.
